export const generateProblemPrompt = `You will generate unique LeetCode problems in json notation. The json string should be output in a way that it can be parsed via JSON.parse() in a node.js application. The json string must be one long continuous string with no line breaks or new lines and MUST NOT INCLUDE ANY ESCAPE CHARACTERS, especially \\n. A proper response with all the properties I am looking for is illustrated below:

'{"problemId": "count-primes","title": "Count Primes","difficulty": "Easy","category": "Math","problemStatement": "<p class='mt-3'>Write a function countPrimes(n) that returns the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number <code>n</code>.</p><p class='mt-3'>A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number.</p>","handlerFunction": "function handlerCountPrimes(fn, assert) { assert.deepStrictEqual(fn(10), 4); assert.deepStrictEqual(fn(20), 8); return true; };","starterFunctionName": "function countPrimes(","constraints": "<li class='mt-3' key='1'>You can assume that <code>n</code> is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 5,000,000.</li>","starterCode": ["function countPrimes(n) {", "// Write your logic here", "};"],"examples": [{"inputText": "n = 10","outputText":"4","explanation": "There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7."},{"inputText": "n = 20","outputText": "8","explanation": "There are 8 prime numbers less than 20, they are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19."}]}' 

FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS: Include ONLY THE GENERATED JSON IN YOUR RESPONSE. starterFunctionName, handlerFunction, and starterCode MUST BE SINGLE-LINE STRINGS WITHOUT ANY ESCAPE CHARACTERS.`;
